Domains are used to indicate that any [routes](#routes) created from the domain will be routed to applications[] running in Cloud Foundry. 


Domains can be shared or private. Shared domains are available to users in all [organizations](#organizations) of a Cloud Foundry. A domain can be made private by tying it to an organization. A private domain may be tied to one or more organizations, called shared organizations. A private domain is only available to users that belong to one of its shared organizations.
